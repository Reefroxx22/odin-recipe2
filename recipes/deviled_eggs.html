    <h1>Deviled Eggs</h1>
    <p>This is a good snack to keep on hand. Lots of nutrients, no sugar, and keeps you from reaching for a sugary snack. The only down side is 
        that it is not filling.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Red Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>Optional: Bacon</li>
        <li>Optional: Green Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I usually do 4 eggs at a time. Hard boil the eggs by placing the eggs in cold water, bringing to a boil and immediately taking them off the heat. 
        Let them continue to cook/sit in the hot water for another 11-12 minutes then stop the cooking process by running them under cold 
        water. This keeps the egg yolks from getting that weird green/black patina.
    </p>
    <p>Halve the eggs and combine all the yolks in a cup. Add a spoonful of mayo (maybe a tbsp), roughly half spoonful of mustard, a drizzle of red wine vinegar,
        some salt, pepper, and smoked paprika and mash it all together with a fork. Start on the stingy side w/these ingredients and add in proportion until you
        get the creamy texture you want. Ease up on the salt if you plan to add bacon.
    </p>
    <p>It's best if you can let them sit overnight to let all the flavors meld, but then they're ready!</p>
