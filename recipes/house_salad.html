    <h1>Michele's House Salad Recipe</h1>

    <p>This is a great "reset salad" that helps bring your balance back after many days of eating junk. The olive oil seems to have
        an anti-inflamatory effect, and the electrolytes, fiber, vitamins and minerals all help bring your skin and digestion back
        to normal.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Greens. For convenience this can come in a spring mix. Buying a head of lettuce takes a little more work but lasts longer in the fridge and probably has more in
        tact nutrients </li>
    
    <li>Shredded carrot </li>
    <li>Mixed nuts. Any mix of sliced almonds, pecan pieces, pumpkin seeds or even a small amount of sunflower seeds (sunflower seeds have a weird texture
        if you add too many, but they're a great source of vitamin e) </li>
    
    <li>Olive oil </li>
    <li>Red wine or balsamic vinegar </li>
    <li>Salt and pepper </li>
    <li>For a sweeter salad, pomegranate or raspberries </li>
    <li>For a savory salad, smoked salmon or tuna salad </li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Mix the greens, carrot, nuts, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and fruit. For a savory salad mix everything but the fruit and put the fish on top. 
        The tuna salad goes well with pomegranate, but not with raspberries. The smoked salmon does not go well with any fruit.
