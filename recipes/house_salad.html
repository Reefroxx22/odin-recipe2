    <h1>Michele's House Salad Recipe</h1>

    <p>This is a great "reset salad" that helps bring your balance back after many days of eating junk. The olive oil seems to have
        an anti-inflamatory effect, and the electrolytes, fiber, vitamins and minerals all help bring your skin and digestion back
        into a comfortable state you can be proud of.
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Greens. For convenience this can come in a spring mix. Buying a head of lettuce takes a little more work but lasts longer and probably has more in
        tact nutrients </li>
    
    <li>Shredded carrot </li>
    <li>Mixed nuts. Any mix of sliced almonds, pecan pieces, pumpkin seeds or even a small amount of sunflower seeds </li>
    
    <li>Olive oil </li>
    <li>Red wine or balsamic vinegar </li>
    <li>Salt and pepper </li>
    <li>For a sweeter salad, pomegrante or raspberries </li>
    <li>For a savory salad, smoked salmon or tuna salad </li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Mix the greens, carrot, nuts, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and fruit. For a savory salad mix everything but the fruit and put the fish on top. Voila!</p>
