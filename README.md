I'm not sure what readme I just updated but it wasn't the right one. 24.12.09
I went to the holiday party last night. I got to spend a lot of time talking to Jaime. 
I felt bad about myself after though, not b/c of anything she said but just looking at the stupid little things I said, 
the dumb petty things I think that I gave voice to. 

I feel better today though, sleep fixes a lot. Also, I believe that you have to be your own advocate, 
and i'm happy to say it's a mantra that works for me.
